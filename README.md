# Twitter-Data-Exploration
I have used semi-structured data from Twitter API and analyzed it with the help of the Tweepy library. I have used some standard natural language processing also known as text mining approaches to do this. I have also done word bigrams and twitter word frequency analysis. At last, I have done sentimental analysis using the textblob library in python.


1.	Part 1: Extract and summarize twitter hashtags
2.	Part 2: Sentimental Analysis
3.	Part 3: Processing a JSON File with Twitter Data
